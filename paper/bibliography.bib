  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bundled payment programs and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services removal of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) from the inpatient-only list potentially incentivize avoiding patients with extended length of stay (eLOS) and nonhome discharge (NHD). We aimed to describe which patients are most at risk of eLOS ({$>$}2 days), very eLOS (veLOS; {$>$}4 days), and NHD. METHODS: Admissions for unilateral TKAs at 151 Illinois nonfederal hospitals from January 2016 to June 2018 were selected from the Illinois Hospital and Health Systems Association COMPdata administrative hospital discharge database. Records included patient age, race and ethnicity, Illinois region, insurance status, principal diagnosis, and date of procedure. Zip code level median household income, Charlson comorbidity index, and obesity status were computed. Hospitals were characterized through their bundled payment participation status, academic status, and annual knee replacement volume. Poisson regression was used to test the associations between patient and hospital characteristics and the likelihood of eLOS, veLOS, and NHD. RESULTS: Of the 72,359 admissions included, 25.0\% had an NHD, 41.1\% had eLOS, and 4.0\% veLOS. Female patients, those 75 years old or more as compared to those 65-74 years old, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics and Asians versus non-Hispanic whites, Medicaid/uninsured patients versus those privately insured, obese patients, those with nonzero Charlson comorbidity index, and those treated at low-volume hospitals ({$<$}200 TKAs/year vs {$>$}600 TKAs/year) were more likely to have eLOS, veLOS, and/or NHD (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSION: Arthroplasty surgeons may be incentivized to avoid the abovementioned patient groups due to bundled payment programs and recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services legislation.},

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of machine learning models against the traditionally derived Combined Assessment of Risk Encountered in Surgery (CARES) model and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists-Physical Status (ASA-PS) in the prediction of 30-day postsurgical mortality and need for intensive care unit (ICU) stay {$>$}24{$\mkern1mu$}hours. BACKGROUND: Prediction of surgical risk preoperatively is important for clinical shared decision-making and planning of health resources such as ICU beds. The current growth of electronic medical records coupled with machine learning presents an opportunity to improve the performance of established risk models. METHODS: All patients aged 18 years and above who underwent noncardiac and nonneurological surgery at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) between 1 January 2012 and 31 October 2016 were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory results, and surgery details were obtained from their electronic medical records. Seventy percent of the observations were randomly selected for training, leaving 30\% for testing. Baseline models were CARES and ASA-PS. Candidate models were trained using random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). RESULTS: A total of 90,785 patients were included, of whom 539 (0.6\%) died within 30 days and 1264 (1.4\%) required ICU admission {$>$}24{$\mkern1mu$}hours postoperatively. Baseline models achieved high AUROCs despite poor sensitivities by predicting all negative in a predominantly negative dataset. Gradient boosting was the best performing model with AUPRCs of 0.23 and 0.38 for mortality and ICU admission outcomes respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning can be used to improve surgical risk prediction compared to traditional risk calculators. AUPRC should be used to evaluate model predictive performance instead of AUROC when the dataset is imbalanced.},

The purpose of this study is to assess the role of demographics, medical comorbidities, and postsurgical complications in predicting safe discharge to home within 24~hours after TKA. Methods Patients undergoing primary TKA between 2011 and 2016 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients were grouped into those whose length of stay (LOS) was less than 24~hours after surgery vs those greater than 24~hours. Demographics, preoperative comorbidities, operative variables, and postoperative adverse events were studied as risk factors for LOS greater than 24~hours. Results A total of 210,075 patients undergoing primary TKA met the inclusion criteria, and of those, 18,134 (8.6\%) patients were discharged within 24~hours postoperatively. In a risk-adjusted multivariate analysis, patients with increasing age, obesity, preoperative comorbidities of smoking, diabetes, dyspnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, bleeding disorder, corticosteroid use preoperatively, and dependent functional status conferred a greater risk for discharge greater than 24~hours. Male gender, spinal anesthesia, and monitored anesthesia care were protective against LOS greater than 24~hours. Conclusion This study suggests that dependent functional status, preoperative comorbidities, and postoperative complications are all associated with a LOS greater than 24~hours after TKA. Surgeons and patients should be aware of the clinical and demographic variables associated with risk for LOS greater than 24~hours when considering outpatient status for patients undergoing TKA.},

We aimed to summarize the evidence on preoperative screening protocols targeting modifiable risk factors to assess their effect on postoperative outcomes following primary LE-TJA. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases was performed in August 2019. The bibliographies of relevant publications were searched for further applicable studies. Included studies were required to report at least one outcome including prosthetic joint infection/surgical site infection (PJI/SSI), hospital length of stay (LOS), disposition, 90-day emergency department visits, or hospital readmissions after implementation of an evidence-based preoperative optimization protocol targeting modifiable risk factors. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 8 retrospective cohort studies including 9915 patients were reviewed. Implementation of preoperative optimization protocols were associated with reductions in SSI (0.56\% vs. 2.60\%; RR 0.21 [95\% CI 0.12 to 0.37]; P {$<$} .00001), hospital LOS, mean cost of care, and hospital readmission rates. The mean MINORS score for comparative studies was 16.285. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation and compliance with evidence-based preoperative protocols for optimization of modifiable risk factors is associated with overall improved outcomes following LE-TJA. SSI, hospital LOS, average total cost of care, and hospital readmission rates were favorable in those cohorts subjected to a preoperative intervention protocol. Future prospective studies are necessary for further refinement of preoperative optimization protocols and referral algorithms, without compromising patients' access to surgery.

We used multiple regression analysis of potential risk factors for LOS {$>$} 2 days followed by construction of a simple risk score from 0 to 15 points based on the calculated odds ratios.Results - Mean LOS was 1.9 (SD 1.8) days, with 80\% of patients having surgery from Monday to Wednesday. Of these, 17\% (95\% CI 16-18) had a LOS {$>$} 2 days vs. 19\% (CI 17-21) in those operated on Thursday and Friday.

Secondary objectives were to construct simple preoperative risk scores for ‘severe medical’, ‘surgical’ and ‘total’ potentially preventable complications. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Elective primary unilateral total hip and knee arthroplasty with prospectively collected preoperative patient characteristics; similar standardised fast-track protocols; evaluation of complications through discharge and medical records; and complete 90 days follow-up through nationwide databases. Participants 8373 consecutive unselected total hip arthroplasty (THA) and knee arthroplasty from January 2010 to November 2012. Results There were 557 procedures (6.4\%) followed by potentially preventable complications resulting in hospitalisation {$>$}4 days or readmission. Of 22 preoperative characteristics, 7 were associated with 379 (4.2\%) potentially preventable ‘medical’ complications. Patients with ≥2 of the following, age ≥80 years, anticoagulant therapy, pulmonary disease, pharmacologically treated psychiatric disorder, anaemia and walking aids, composed 19.1\% of the procedures; 55.7\% constituted potentially preventable ‘medical’ complications that were mainly falls, mobilisation issues, pneumonias and cardiac arrhythmias. The number needed to be treated for a hypothetical intervention leading to 25\% reduction in potentially preventable ‘medical’ complications was 34. THA, use of walking aids and cardiac disease were associated with 189 (2.2\%) ‘surgical’ complications, but no clinically relevant preoperative prediction was possible. Conclusions Preoperative identification of patients at high risk of preventable ‘medical’, but not ‘surgical’, complications is statistically possible. However, clinical relevance is limited. Future risk indices should differ between ‘medical’ and ‘surgical’ complications, and also consider ‘preventability’ of these. Trial registration number NCT01515670.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model’s performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

Our multicentre study in a socialized healthcare setting was associated with a continuous reduction in LOS and morbidity after THA and TKA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) yields substantial improvements in quality of life for patients with severe osteoarthritis. Previous research has shown that TKA outcomes are inferior in patients with certain demographic and clinical factors. Length of stay (LOS) following TKA is a major component of costs incurred by healthcare providers. It is hypothesized that patient-related factors may influence LOS following TKA. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate these factors. METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and OVID Medline) were searched using variants of the terms "total knee arthroplasty" and "length of stay". Studies were screened and data abstracted in duplicate. The primary outcome was the effect of prognostic variables on LOS following TKA. Meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) software (version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). RESULTS: A total of 68 studies met~all inclusion criteria for this review. These studies comprised 21,494,459 patients undergoing TKA with mean age 66.82 years (range, 15-95 years) and 63.8\% (12,165,160 of 19,060,572 reported) females. The mean MINORS score was 7, suggesting that studies had a low quality of evidence. Mean LOS following TKA has steadily decreased over the past 4 decades, partially because of the implementation of fast-track programs. Demographic factors associated with increased LOS were age {$>$}70 years (mean difference [MD]~= 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI]~= 0.38-1.24), female gender (MD~= 0.32; 95\% CI~= 0.29-0.48), body mass index {$>$}30 (MD~= 0.09; 95\% CI~= 0.01-0.16), and non-White race (MD~= 0.20; 95\% CI~= 0.10-0.29). Clinical factors associated with increased LOS were American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3-4 vs 1-2 (MD~= 1.12; 95\% CI~= 0.58 to 1.66), Charlson Comorbidity Index {$>$} 0 vs 0 (MD~= 0.77; 95\% CI~= 0.32 to 1.22), and preoperative hemoglobin {$<$} 130 g/L (MD~= 0.66; 95\% CI~= 0.34 to 0.98). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that increased age, female gender, body mass index ≥ 30, non-White race, American Society of Anesthesiologists {$>$} 2, Charlson Comorbidity Index {$>$} 0, and preoperative hemoglobin {$<$} 130 g/L were predictors of increased LOS. Mean LOS has steadily decreased over the past decades with the implementation of perioperative "fast-track" programs. Future research should investigate the benefits of preoperative risk factor modification on LOS, in addition to novel surgical approaches, anesthetic adjuvants, and physiotherapy modifications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, systematic review, and meta-analysis of level III and IV evidence.},

  abstract = {Classifiers are often tested on relatively small data sets, which should lead to uncertain performance metrics. Nevertheless, these metrics are usually taken at face value. We present an approach to quantify the uncertainty of classification performance metrics, based on a probability model of the confusion matrix. Application of our approach to classifiers from the scientific literature and a classification competition shows that uncertainties can be surprisingly large and limit performance evaluation. In fact, some published classifiers are likely to be misleading. The application of our approach is simple and requires only the confusion matrix. It is agnostic of the underlying classifier. Our method can also be used for the estimation of sample sizes that achieve a desired precision of a performance metric.},
